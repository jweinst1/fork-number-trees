# Fork Number Trees

*An extremely fast data structure with worst case constant lookup time*

## Intro

Fork Number Trees are data structures that can provide extremely fast lookups and inserts, that are always constant in complexity. This is different than a hash table, that are at worst case, linear compelxity. Fork Number Trees (FNTs) also providea memory usage that stays consistent as the number of items stored in a tree increases.
